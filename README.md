# Repository for the course: DAT450 / DIT245 Machine learning for natural language processing

This repository consists of the projects and homework for the NLP course I read at Gothenburg University / Chalmers University. All project except the third one was done in collaboration with Rode Gr√∂nkvist.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my experience in Python, NLP, and neural networks in PyTorch, this is best shown in the directories Assignment3 and even better in Final_project that includes a written report and a video presentation.
