# Neural Interlingua for Zero-shot machine Translation

## Abstract
We create a multilingual encoder-decoder model for neural machine translation with an explicit interlingua layer and train it to translate between English, German and Swedish. This lets our encoders and de- coders work for multiple language pairs. We achieve reasonable performance on en- coding and decoding the same language as well as the bilingual translation tasks the model was trained on, but we fail to achieve zero-shot translation between a pair of languages that was not included in training.
